# Todo List
There are some improvements to make and some changes that are required.
This list hopes to keep track so they get done.

  1. Release new authgateway (npm updates) and update it.
  2. Update MongoDB to 4.2 && PostgreSQL to 12?
  3. Fix Grafana deprecation warning about phantomJS.
  4. Additional metrics collection:
      * Postfix exporter (number of emails sent).
      * SystemD (depends on metrics, with focus on timers).
      * NextCloud (PHP?; focus on security warnings?).
      * Podman metrics?
      * FireFly-III/PHP?
      * Wekan? (Node?/Meteor?).
